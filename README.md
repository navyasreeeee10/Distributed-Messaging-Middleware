# Distributed Messaging Middleware with Causal and Total Ordering

## 📘 Overview
This project simulates a **Distributed Messaging Middleware** that ensures messages are delivered in **causal** and **total order** across multiple nodes.  
It demonstrates how distributed systems maintain **reliable and consistent communication**, supporting **SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**.

---

## 🌍 Relevance to SDG 9
**Sustainable Development Goal 9** focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation.  
This simulation contributes by showcasing reliable message ordering — a key part of modern distributed and industrial communication systems.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- **Causal Ordering:** Delivers messages respecting event dependencies.  
- **Total Ordering:** Ensures all nodes receive messages in the same global order.  
- **Simulated Nodes:** Multiple nodes communicating through middleware.  
- **Educational Use:** Ideal for learning distributed system concepts.

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** Built-in modules (`time`, `collections`)
